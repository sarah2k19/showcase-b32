            <h3 class="my-3">About the project</h3>
            <p>iDesign is an educational platform where children can
              execute projects following a DBL approach. The
              projects are based on different primary school subjects. In a
              project space guidance is offered through tips and hints.
              We offer a place where children can develop
              attitude, skills, knowledge and talents in their own pace.
              For these children there is also guidance through tips
              and hints. The content of these tips is made to suit the
              level of the student, and the type of guidance required.
              Next to this, to support the learning process of the
              children, we offer a place for teachers to broaden their
              teaching methods. In addition to this, IDesign is also
              a starting point for schools to explore new teaching
              methods safely, to benefit the development of young
              students. As a result they will be better prepared for the future
              where they will have to work in multidisciplinary teams.</p>

          <h3 class="my-3">Reflection</h3>
          This semester I developed my business side, and I applied past knowledge and experience
          with preparing user tests, prototyping methods, and teamwork. On top of this I learned a
          crucial lesson in communication.
          Having focused on the business side, I learned the value of implementing the business side. Before starting this project I thought that the business side was all about making as much money as possible. This semester I found out that the business side is actually all about finding ways to create value for as much people as possible. It is also about analyzing how to best reach your customers,
          and to find the best way to offer your value, and how to make money off of it to keep your company healthy and keep reaching more people/transforming more lives. I used this knowledge to make a Business Model Canvas and a Value Proposition.
          <!--
          The start of the project was a bit rough as we were struggling with what we thought was a strict design brief, and on top of this we had the impression that we were even further restricted by the requirements of the client that we were expected to work together. After some frustration we decided to just try to come up with some concepts. From concept presentations we gave and attended, and from feedback we received we soon found out however that we are not supposed to
          be following the client’s wishes too literally, we are supposed to show them how things should can best be done or achieved. From this I learned that requirements from clients are not fixed. I now understand that it is our job to show them how it should be done. Teamwork went well between me and Art. We brainstormed, worked out ideas, made paper prototypes, pitched to each other, and
          gave each other feedback to get our motivation back for the project. When we had our final concept we took on individual tasks and had progress meetings, where we gave constructive criticism on each other’s work.
          Working one-on-one makes it easier to say everything on your mind, as there are less feelings involved. This creates a good work atmosphere and keeps productivity high. From this experience I would like to take with me to split up during projects in small 1-on-1 sessions where me and my group person can do about 1 hour of serious work. After this hour we will be able to show our results to our other group members, and then within this group we can make a final decision. This would be my preferred method over sitting around a table with 4 people wondering what we should do next.
          This semester was too stressful for me. I was working together with someone that repeatedly  showed up late to meetings without notice, who didn’t deliver his work and who kept making promises without living up to them. Initially I didn’t communicate honestly about  how his attitude frustrated me, as I was hoping to be able to continue in Q2 without him.
          We weren’t allowed to split up, so I reflected on my own attitude in the first quartile. I concluded that I could have given him a sense of freedom, which could have helped him to find his own rhythm and working method. We also had a group meeting where we voiced our experiences with Q1 honestly. In this meeting many promising words were said for a better quartile. Unfortunately the effort didn’t change much. Fortunately I learned from this. I still believe second chances are fair, and
          everyone deserves one. However there should be clear consequences that are agreed upon when this second chance is given. These consequences should provide security to the part of the team that is left with the extra workload. I didn’t take this step this time, and it resulted in stress, frustration and extra workload. The lesson I learned from this is to tackle a problem when it occurs, to communicate honestly, and most importantly to make clear agreements with strict deadlines. These
          are also the actions I will undertake if I ever were to find myself in a similar situation as I was in this semester.
