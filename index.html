            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Identity: </br>
              I identify as an experience and interaction designer. As a designer, I am interested in and research how to achieve creative personal spaces and products.
As a person I am analytical, and as a designer I use this characteristic to take an analytical approach and a create a to thorough understanding of my context, involving experts, users and literature research. Consulting and sharing ideas with fellow designers and design researchers is a very important part of my process, as this pushes me to understand and think from different perspectives.
I design for the target group that I myself belong in.
            </p>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Vision: </br>
              My vision on design is that products and services should be constantly improved, and this should be done by learning from the past. To achieve this, qualitative and quantitative data collected on how the product is being used needs to be consulted.
Interaction with any design should feel good, and should be interactive in some way. The meaning it carries to the user should be personal, and the meaning the user gives to the design should be open. I see design as a form of art that allows us to connect with ourselves, our friends and our family. It should be light, fun, free and enjoyable.

                      <p>iDesign is an educational platform where children can execute projects following a DBL approach. The projects are based on different primary school subjects. In a project space guidance is offered through tips and hints. We offer a place where children can develop attitude, skills, knowledge and talents in their own pace. For these children there is also guidance through tips and hints. The content of these tips is made to suit the level of the student, and the type of guidance required. Next to this, to support the learning process of the children, we offer a place for teachers to broaden their teaching methods. In addition to this, IDesign is also a starting point for schools to explore new teaching methods safely, to benefit the development of young students. As a result they will be better prepared for the future where they will have to work in multidisciplinary teams.

                      <p>Domestic violence harms many children each year. This in itself is a big problem that has been present for too long. On top of this, the general public usually assumes that the abuse happens only from men on women. The reality is that 1 in 3 of the reported cases are from women on men. Keep in mind that many cases aren’t reported because men who get abused by women are often ridiculed and not taken seriously. This holds men back from coming out with their story to get help. We want to help families in difficult situations by teaching children in a playful way how to react when they notice or suspect their friend is having a hard time (at home). Children that play the game will also get hints on where they can go for help, for example: teachers and supervisors at school or at kindergarten. We developed a RPG game where you and your friends go on a camping trip with school. You play a dwarf, no gender is linked to this character (or to your fellow dwarf friends). At the beginning of the game you notice some strange things happening to your friends while playing hide-and-seek . By talking to your friends you find out it’s one of your friends causing trouble. You talk to him and find out that your friend has trouble at home. Throughout the game you help your friend to resolve their problems. This report describes the design process we went through to reach our goal.

                      <p>Lior is a informative decorative phone case, with coloured tiles on the case. The phone case was designed to improve the experience of user-notification, and the case is linked to whatsapp. Whatsapp groups can be tagged with a certain category, like ‘Friends’ ‘Family’ or ‘Groupwork’. Each group is then linked to a colour. When a message is received from this text group, a tile on the phone case will light up in this colour. The target group for Lior are students and young professionals. The design of the case is a result of several user interviews. The final design was evaluated with two students. The outcome showed that our phone case could be used to decrease the amount of unnecessary unlocking phones to check for messages. It could also possibly improve the experience of formal and informal group meetings. Future improvements include improving the distribution of light in the case.

                      <p>Changes in Dutch legislation which dictates the time an elderly patient is given to be taken care of, have led to inconsistent care experiences in Dutch care homes. This problem provided the basis of this study. This study aims to provide concrete suggestions and considerations to be taken into account when designing a research probe for the context of elderly care homes, as well as to explain the reasoning behind these suggestions. Data was gathered through caregivers and clients at Vitalis Kronehoef, a long term care home for elderly in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with varying degrees of cognitive and physical impairment. The research was performed with a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative data collection through a physical measuring probe, and qualitative data through interviews and diary studies. The findings show that research probes to be implemented in this context should be robust, small enough to fit into a pocket, easy to use and very un-intimidating. It is also suggested to avoid traditional diary studies with the elderly and to rely more on face to face interview methods. For caregivers, it is suggested to make qualitative data gathering as easy and fast as possible, as these participants are very limited in the time they have to participate. The use of calm technology and peripheral interaction in this setting was found to be an interesting design opportunity in this context.
