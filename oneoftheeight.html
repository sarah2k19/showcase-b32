            <p>Domestic violence harms many children each year. This in itself is a big problem that
              has been present for too long. On top of this, the general public usually assumes that
              the abuse happens only from men on women. The reality is that 1 in 3 of the reported
              cases are from women on men. Keep in mind that many cases aren’t reported because
              men who get abused by women are often ridiculed and not taken seriously.
              This holds men back from coming out with their story to get help.
              We want to help families in difficult situations by teaching children in a playful way
              how to react when they notice or suspect their friend is having a hard time (at home).
              Children that play the game will also get hints on where they can go for help, for example:
              teachers and supervisors at school or at kindergarten.
              We developed a RPG game where you and your friends go on a camping trip with
              school. You play a dwarf, no gender is linked to this character (or to your fellow dwarf
              friends). At the beginning of the game you notice some strange things happening to
              your friends while playing hide-and-seek . By talking to your friends you find out it’s
              one of your friends causing trouble. You talk to him and find out that your friend has
              trouble at home. Throughout the game you help your friend to resolve their problems.
              This report describes the design process we went through to reach our goal.</p>

          <h3 class="my-3">Reflection</h3>
          I chose this project, Persuasive Game Design, because I was interested in finding out
          how to change people’s behaviour in a playful way. My goals for this project were to
          conduct a user-test with our target group, to be involved with the creative side of the
          creating of the prototype, and to be the implementer of the team. I wanted to be the
          implementer because I had been the team leader in my previous project.
          I had the role of the Creative Director where I made the creative decisions. As an implementer
          of the team I designed the environment of our final game. During our two
          user-tests I was able to ask questions to the children on what they thought of the environment,
          and how they experienced the world that I designed. I used their answers
          to improve my levels for the final prototype.
