            <p>Changes in Dutch legislation which dictates the time an
              elderly patient is given to be taken care of, have led to
              inconsistent care experiences in Dutch care homes. This
              problem provided the basis of this study. This study aims to
              provide concrete suggestions and considerations to be taken
              into account when designing a research probe for the context
              of elderly care homes, as well as to explain the reasoning
              behind these suggestions. Data was gathered through
              caregivers and clients at Vitalis Kronehoef, a long term care
              home for elderly in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, with
              varying degrees of cognitive and physical impairment. The
              research was performed with a mixed methods approach,
              combining quantitative data collection through a physical
              measuring probe, and qualitative data through interviews and
              diary studies. The findings show that research probes to be
              implemented in this context should be robust, small enough
              to fit into a pocket, easy to use and very un-intimidating. It is
              also suggested to avoid traditional diary studies with the
              elderly and to rely more on face to face interview methods.
              For caregivers, it is suggested to make qualitative data
              gathering as easy and fast as possible, as these participants
              are very limited in the time they have to participate. The use
              of calm technology and peripheral interaction in this setting
              was found to be an interesting design opportunity in this
              context.</p>

          <h3 class="my-3">Reflection</h3>
          My goals for this project were to learn how to conduct a design research in a living lab, to understand how design research project differs from a regular design project, to use my new skills in programming and collaborative programming to work more efficiently on the technology, and to get over my anxiety to ask feedback from coaches. I met these goals through active participation in the process.

  The main skill I brought into the team was my experience with programming with other people in couples and teams. I took an active role in almost all phases of the project, including two in-depth interviews, the writing of the results and discussion, as well as analyzing the results.

  What I did in the first quartile
  In the first half of quartile 1 we were focused on understanding the context of nursing homes. We did this through literature research and several interviews at Vitalis. Our findings showed the challenges within Vitalis are different from the challenges we found in literature, so I learned the importance of specifying, visiting and understanding the context you are designing for and researching in.
  After finishing the idea generation for our probe, I started realizing the technology for our probe to present at the midterm demo day, applying skills I had from previous courses.

  What I did in the second quartile
  In quartile 2, Peter took over the biggest part of my technology responsibility, I only jumped in when he got stuck with the coding. This allowed me to take upon me the role of making sure everyone was on the same page. I made the conscious decision to follow one course this quartile, this gave me flexibility which I used to schedule extra meetings with Rens, as well as visit Lu Yuan and Hugo for feedback, to make sure what we were doing was in line with their expectations.

  It was very important for me to practice asking for feedback, as I have been struggling with anxiety to ask for feedback in the past. With the help of my study advisor who coached me on the side, and positive reinforcement of my team I was able to relax a bit and surpass this boundary. What helped in this was the great willingness and openness from the coaches to help us when we asked (thanks!). It is a work in progress, but I can say with confidence that I am heading in the right direction.

  Design research proces
  As mentioned in our paper several times, we opted for a mixed method research approach, which was needed to answer our initial research question, which focused on the consistency in care. When data collection went wrong, we adapted our approach and switched to a quantitative research approach. From this I learned the importance of being flexible in research. Unexpected things can happen, and it’s not bad thing. It just means we need to change our approach in order to meet our goal.

  Competencies interplay and planning
  A team planning was made, and we tried our best to keep on top of it. Technology and realization related deadlines were easily met, sometimes requiring extra work from me, Pelle or Peter. DRP requires more flexibility, as it might require a change in strategy, as happened with our project. This of course had to do with our focus group, which is a group of very busy nurses with different priorities than ours. After this project I am now confident I have a good understanding of the different competency areas depend on each other, and how to apply them and prioritize efficiently in the context of research. What I would do differently next time is to take some extra time in the start of the project to truly understand the rhythm of our focus group into account, and base our design to suit their routine.

  Reflection
  Within the team, I felt that flexibility came natural to Daisy, Pelle and I, but was harder to understand and appreciate by Peter. I felt he had a hard time to understand that design research in our context is unpredictable and sometimes put our process on hold as we felt he was not willing to listen to other options.
  I would say that Daisy, Pelle and I were able to work together very well, finding qualities in each other and using these qualities to the best benefit, and allowing each other to develop and grow in areas that we are less developed in. What I found slightly disappointing was Peter’s attitude towards us. I find it very important to get team input and often end my suggestions by posing a question to the rest of the group about their opinion. Peter would only answer my questions with another question, which created a distance between us. I assume he wanted me to think for myself, which I found patronizing as I already had an answer, I just want the team’s input and make sure everyone agrees, or at least is up to date of the progress I have made. Unfortunately we were already in the demo day week by the time I was able to pinpoint what was bothering me about his attitude in team meetings.
